As I shut the door of my house it made a slammed behind me.
 After some time of walking I saw a cat walking on the street purring as it got some food from some kids.
A chirping bird flew over my head and the cat darted hissing to the bird.
I caught the cat so it wont scare the cat anymore and put it down off the road.
Now I was able to see some trees of the park a bit far away.
I headed quickly stomping loudly on the sidewalk  scaring the singing birds.
